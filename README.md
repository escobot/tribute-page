# Build a Tribute Page

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.

* User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

## Notes

The page was originally created by me in 2016 and can be found on [codepen](https://codepen.io/pbgnz/full/jrOjQq)
